This folder contains the downloader module. Each executable file in this folder is interpreted as a separat module, so if your module requires multiple files please put them in a different location, or folder.

In order to check capabilities, each executable should return a \n separated list of supported hosts (e.g. "http://share-online.com") when executed with the -h flag.

When executed with the -l flag, followed by a file, the script should donwload the link list into it's current working directory.
